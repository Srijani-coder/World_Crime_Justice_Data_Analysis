In each year, we can notice that the law index scores of developing countries are significantly less than those of developed countries for each of the factors of criminal justice. Low scores in some factors indicate severe issues.
For example, for the factor “Criminal system is free from improper Government Influence” , China scores only 0.14. This can lead to severe problems for the country's citizens .


Most of the developed countries use advanced technologies and modern artificial intelligence in a few factors to maintain their governance these days.
